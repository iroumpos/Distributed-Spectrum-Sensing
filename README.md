**Distributed Spectrum Sensing**

This project was done as partial fullfilements of the course Advanced Topics in Computer Networks.\
The aim of this project was to implement a software for distributed spectrum sensing using PlutoSDR.\
Also, a database was created that combines,processes and visualizes the captured data through a spectrogram \
and a Power Spectral Density(PSD) - Frequency plot.
